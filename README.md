Collaborative Coding of Battleship Game

This is the final project for the Pyladies begginers course autumn 2023/2024! This code simulates a round of battleship where the player plays against their computer. The first function creates and prints the board, then the user can select the positions and sizes of their ships. The computer randomly selects a spot on the board to place their ships. The winning condition is met when one side destroyed all ships of the other player. 

There are currently two versions of the game: a simple version where all 5 ships are 1x1 square big and a more complex version where ships have differnet sizes and can also be placed horizontally or vertically.
